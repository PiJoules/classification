%{
Function that generates a data set of Nl-dimensional vectors that stem 
from c different Gaussian distributions N(mi,Si), with corresponding a 
priori probabilities Pi,i=1,...,c.

Args:
- m is an lxc matrix, the i-th column of which is the mean vector of the
  i-th class distribution.
- S is an lxlxc (three-dimensional) matrix, whose ith two-dimensional lxl
  component is the covariance of the distribution of the ith class. In 
  MATLAB S(:, :, i) denotes the i-th two-dimensional lxl matrix of S.
- P is the c dimensional vector that contains the a priori probabilities 
  of the classes. mi, Si, Pi,and c are provided as inputs.

Return:
- A matrix X with (approximately) N columns, each column of which is
  an l-dimensional data vector.
- A row vector y whose ith entry denotes the class from which the ith
  data vector stems.
